## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

We are OptionallyBlueStudios.. We are a games studio that, ironically, also makes a [cheat engine](https://github.com/optionallybluestudios/CheatSpy). We currently don't have any games out, but you can check out our [roblox games studio, RedOptionStudios](https://red-option-studios.github.io). We also ALL like Minecraft and some of us have an obsession with Satisfactory, so thats why we decided to make a [minecraft Satisfactory-Inspired modpack, Satiscraftory](https://satiscraftory-modpack-developers.github.io/Website) (It will say not secure but thats only because we cant get an SSL certificate... :( )

You can contact us via contacts in the discussions tab!
